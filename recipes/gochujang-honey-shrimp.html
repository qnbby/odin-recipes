        <li>garlic powder to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot and sweet pepper paste), or to taste</li>            
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>scallions, sliced diagonally, as a garnish</li>            
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season both sides of shrimp with garlic powder and salt, and set aside.</li>
        <li>
            Combine gochujang, honey, sesame oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic, <br>
            and ginger in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-
            high heat. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is <br>
            opaque, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping half way through; do not overcook. Remove shrimp from the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce temperature to low, and add sauce to skillet. Whisk water and cornstarch together <br>
            in a small bowl to make a slurry. Stir slurry into the sauce until well combined. Keep cooking, <br>
            stirring constantly, until the sauce starts to slightly thicken, about 1 minute. Add shrimp back <br>
            into the skillet and stir until coated and just heated through.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and scallions. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
